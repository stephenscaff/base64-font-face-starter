## Base64 @font-face Starter
This is just a starter file for base64 font-face SCSS files.

For a few years now, I've found that base64'n my fonts is the best way to enusre legit bullet proof delivery. Actually wrote [a post about this](http://stephenscaff.com/articles/2013/09/font-face-and-base64-data-uri/) way back in 2013 that is still the number google return surprisingly.

The purpose of this file is to provide a template file that you can simply copy and rename - probably to the name of the typeface your using. Then, just paste in your base64 font, and provide the font-name, weight and font-style where indicated.

Keep all your font-names the same bruv, and just let the font-weight / font-style handle which font-face is used. 

## WOFF It

I find it best to use Woffs. If you don't have a WOFF of your font, [here is a nice converter](everythingfonts.com/otf-to-woff).

While you can handle the base64 with a bash script, [here is a great encoder](https://www.giftofspeed.com/base64-encoder/).
